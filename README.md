This document provides a highly detailed and precise plan for building Vurticle, covering UI/UX, frontend, and backend architecture with granular specifications.
________________________________________
Vurticle: Detailed System Design & Implementation Plan
Part 1: Project Overview & Core Principles
Vurticle is an AI Agentic Data Platform designed to ingest, process, classify, and synthesize public domain libraries, engineering, technical, and research data. Its core output is a processed, classified, insightful form of this data, presented as both chunks (text segments) and structured schemas (JSON objects). The platform's "agentic" nature allows for dynamic, intelligent interaction and the creation of deeply correlated documents.
Core Principles:
1.	Data Transformation: From unstructured text to structured, interconnected knowledge.
2.	AI-Driven Intelligence: Leveraging LLMs and BERTopic for advanced processing, summarization, and insight generation.
3.	Agentic Interaction: Dynamic tool calling and multi-step reasoning to fulfill complex user queries.
4.	Multi-Modal Retrieval: Combining keyword, semantic, and schema-based search for comprehensive data access.
5.	Contextual Understanding: Presenting information with its full context, including consequential relationships and topic classifications.
6.	Scalability & Reliability: Designed for high throughput and availability using modern cloud-native architectures.
Part 2: Data Model & Knowledge Fabric Definition
Vurticle's knowledge fabric is built upon a precise data model, primarily stored in Firebase Firestore for metadata and schemas, and a Proprietary Search Engine for indexing and retrieval.

	Update chunk.elaborate_expansion in Firebase.
	LLM Call 2 (Metric/Parametric Schema Generation):
	Prompt: "From the following text: '{chunk_text}'. Extract all possible metric and parametric data. Include quantifiable values, descriptive properties, and categorical labels. Consider logistics parameters, cost parameters, innovation and economic activity factors, initiatives, differentiators, determinants, labels, fundamental designs, and consideration horizons. Output as a JSON object. If no data, return empty JSON."
	Example Output Format (for LLM): {"material_name": "...", "tensile_strength_mpa": ..., "cost_per_kg_usd": ..., "logistics_parameters": {"supply_chain_stability": "...", ...}, ...}
	Parse LLM output, validate JSON.
	Create schema entry in Firebase (type: "metric_parametric").

6.	Update document.processing_status to schema_gen.
7.	Step 3: Consequential Schema Generation (Batch Processing)
	Monitor metric_parametric schemas for the document. When 10 are available (or periodically):
	Push Celery task generate_consequential_schema_task to RabbitMQ.
	Celery Task (generate_consequential_schema_task):
	Fetch 10 metric_parametric schemas.
	LLM Call:
	Prompt: "Analyze these 10 metric/parametric schemas: {json_list_of_schemas}. Identify any potential cause-and-effect relationships, implications, synergies, vulnerabilities, or dependencies between the described entities (e.g., materials, mechanisms, operational techniques, architectures). Focus on implementations in various contexts, their consequentiality, automation records, exploits of variances, uniformities, convergences, and divergences. Output as a JSON array of Consequential Schemas with if_condition, then_consequence, context, application_domain, correlation_strength, source_insight_type fields."
	Parse LLM output, validate JSON.

Part 6: Key Technical Challenges & Mitigation Strategies
1.	LLM Cost & Latency:
o	Mitigation:
	Batching: Grouping LLM calls where possible (e.g., 10 schemas for consequential, 50 chunks for short summary).
	Caching: Cache LLM responses for common queries or expansions.
	Prompt Engineering Optimization: Fine-tune prompts to be concise yet effective, reducing token usage.
	Model Selection: Use smaller, faster models for simpler tasks (e.g., summarization) and larger models for complex reasoning (e.g., consequential schema generation).
	Asynchronous Processing: All LLM calls are non-blocking via Celery.
	Rate Limiting: Implement client-side rate limiting for LLM APIs.
2.	Proprietary Search Engine Performance & Scalability:
o	Mitigation:
	Optimized Indexing: Efficient data structures for vector, keyword, schema, and graph indexes.
	Partitioning: Heavy reliance on topic-based partitions and application consequentiality based partitions to reduce search space.
	Distributed Architecture: Design the search engine itself to be horizontally scalable across multiple nodes.
	Caching: Aggressive caching of frequently accessed search results.
	Hardware Acceleration: Leverage GPUs for vector similarity search if applicable.
3.	Data Quality & LLM Hallucinations:
o	Mitigation:
	Robust Prompt Engineering: Detailed, specific prompts with clear output formats (JSON).
	Output Validation: Programmatic validation of LLM-generated JSON schemas.
	Human-in-the-Loop Feedback: Frontend allows users to correct/refine schemas, feeding back into model improvement.
	Confidence Scores: LLMs can be prompted to provide confidence scores for extractions, allowing the system to flag lower-confidence data for review.
	Source Attribution: Always link back to original chunk_id and document_id for verification.
4.	BERTopic Model Management:
o	Mitigation:
	Incremental Training: Explore BERTopic's capabilities for incremental updates to avoid full re-training on every new document.
	Topic Evolution Tracking: Monitor topic drift and emergence of new topics.
	Human Curation: Admin panel allows manual merging/splitting/re-labeling of topics to maintain quality.
5.	Deep Scraping Complexity:
o	Mitigation:
	Adaptive Parsing: Use libraries like trafilatura that are robust to varying website structures.
	Heuristic-Based Link Following: Prioritize links based on content keywords and URL patterns to avoid irrelevant content.
	Rate Limiting & IP Rotation: To avoid being blocked by websites.
	Error Handling: Robust error handling for network issues, malformed HTML, anti-scraping measures.
This detailed plan provides a solid foundation for the development of Vurticle, ensuring all specified requirements are met with a focus on precision, scalability, and an intelligent user experience.
